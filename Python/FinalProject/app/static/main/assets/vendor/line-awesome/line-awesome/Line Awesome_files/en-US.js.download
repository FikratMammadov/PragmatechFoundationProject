They are only <b>16 pixels tall</b>, thus we called them 1em (1em=16px). The problem that web designers are aware: once inserted in text, the icons break the line, making text “dance” and overall make design look chaotic. <i>1em</i> is the only icon pack that follows the text, i.e. looks natural in a line of text of a standard font size. Of course, you can scale it up for larger text. A good idea is to generate a font and use it along with your text (we have a built-in <a href="https://icons8.com/articles/how-to-convert-icons-to-a-web-font/" class="is-blue">font generator</a>).

There\'s a newer visual style from Microsoft, <a href="https://icons8.com/download-huge-windows8-set/" class="is-blue">Windows 10</a>. Still, Metro is a valid style for tiles, those color boxes in the start menu. Finally, it is merely a pretty style, especially for ordinary people who don\'t read the operating system design guidelines for breakfast.',PLATFORM_DESCRIPTION:'These {{platformTitle}} {{term}} icons belong to our {{count}} icon set.
